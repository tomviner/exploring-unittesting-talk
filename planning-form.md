# Exploring unit-testing with PyUnit (aka unittest), nose and pytest

We'll start by briefly introducing our three test frameworks:
- unittest (sometimes called PyUnit) and it's xUnit origins
- nose: "extends unittest to make testing easier"
- pytest: more pythonic tests?

We'll look at several features of unit-testing and how they're covered by our frameworks. Covering:
- running your tests
- a minimal test: with class or function?
- setting up the environment for a test, and clearing up afterwards
- happy path: asserting the expected truth
- provoking failure: ensuring exceptions raised

In the remaining time we'll move on to some more advanced techniques:
- parameterised test generators
- skipping and xfails
- next level: marking your params


Extras:
- marking tests
-- for filtering
-- for comms
- skiponimportfail etc
- plugins
-- so so many
- command line params
