# review

- arrange, act, assert
- arrange: setUp v @fixture
- act: please try the (framework) neutral swiss cheese
- assert: assertThis v naked assert

- monolithic class
    - with TestCase you must group your tests by common setUp
    - may prefer to group tests by the feature they test
- with pytest you can group by related tests
    - reusable beyond a single class, possibly even share between projects


- unittest is the standard
    - stood the test of time
- pytest is the challenger
    - lots of functionality
    - rich ecosystem of plugins
- in the end: you decide the winner!
